# 💱 Currency Converter – Full Stack Project

This repository contains a **full-stack currency converter application** built as part of the **TA Solutions technical assessment**.

The project follows a **clean, production-ready architecture**, with:
- **Frontend** built in React + TypeScript
- **Backend** built in NestJS
- **Secure API usage** (API key never exposed)
- **Persistent conversion history**
- **Mobile-first UI**
- **Live deployments**
